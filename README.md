# FindingDensityOfLiquidCompounds
- Made in less than 30 minutes.
- A console-based application that finds the density of liquid compounds on varying temperatures.

# What I learned
- Computing for density of liquid compounds
- Using for-loops for iterating through different temperatures at a specific interval (in this case, 10).
